# Backend / Ebook: Exercise video spec

Use these videos and start times for all exercises in the app and ebook.

| Exercise / section | Video | Start time |
|-------------------|--------|------------|
| **Body line drill** | https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2GnjFzWCXRU | (from start) |
| **Protracted plank** | https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SLSi5oou1ws | 0:05 |
| **Wrist drills / Fin push-ups** (all levels) | https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Uo4qAzodPlM | 0:14 (same as Level 1) |
| **Chest to wall handstand** | (existing CTW video) | 1:00 |
| **Hollow body hold** | https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q4Xj8Nj7RQY | (from start) |
| **Hollow body — beginner variation** | https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DhF2_tGgXJE | (from start) |
| **Heel pulls / Toe pulls** | (existing heel/toe videos) | 1:40 |
| **Level 4** | All sections must have videos, same as other levels (already in API). |
| **Handstand conditioning** | https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFziwQ5ixx8 | (from start) — use in ebook / any conditioning section; not an API exercise key. |
| **Handstand shoulder taps** | https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r8WwpGQlq7U | 0:10 |
| **Freestanding handstand** | https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NSj-238hdbg | 1:20 |

Ensure the **ebook** and any other content that references these exercises use the same URLs and start times. The API `data/levels.js` has been updated so the app gets these from the backend; the ebook (if separate) should be updated to match.
